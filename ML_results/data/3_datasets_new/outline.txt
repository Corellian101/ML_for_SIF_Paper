1. split up a/c into a/c <=1 and a/c > 1
	a. solve at phi = pi/2 to remove phi dependence as g goes to 1 for dataset3 use FULL
		i. solve for m
		ii. divide mg by m and solve for g
			iia. solve for g on PHI SAMPLE
			iib. solve for g FULL 
	b. solve without splitting m and g 
		i. solve with PHI SAMPLE
		ii. solve with FULL

2. train on datset 1,2,3 for all values of a/c at once FULL and PHI SAMPLE
